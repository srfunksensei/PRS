# Computer Systems Performance, Analysis Techniques for Experimental Design, Measurements Simulation and Modeling

A simulation model of a multiprogram computer that has two processors, two system disks and K user disks for which it is determined by analysis and simulation:  
- resource utilization,  
- flow through resources,  
- the average number of jobs in each of the resources of this system,  
- system response time (average duration of one cycle, from when the process enters the processor order, until it comes to that order the next time) for K from 2 to 6  
- critical resource in the system.

## Structure

Repository is organized as following:
- `doc` directory contains assignment as well as solution document(s)
- `source` directory contains code
